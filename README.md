# 🤖 AutoResolve: Real-Time LLM-Based Support Ticket Classifier Using Confluent Cloud

🧩 Problem Statement:
Customer support systems today are drowning in a flood of tickets. Some are simple “password reset” queries, others are complex enterprise-level breakdowns. But here’s the problem:

80% of tickets are repetitive and solvable with existing knowledge—but agents still spend hours manually resolving them.

Prioritization is chaotic—a platinum customer’s urgent issue may be buried under lower-priority tickets.

SLAs are missed, and customer satisfaction suffers.

Support teams are burning out, and retention costs are rising.

**What if we could reduce the average resolution time by 70%, automate common issues, and intelligently triage the rest—**all in real-time?

Built for hackathons. Designed for production.
